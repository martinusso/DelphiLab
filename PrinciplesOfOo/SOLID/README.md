The Principles of Object Oriented Programming
| acronym | Concept |
| :-----: | :------ |
| SRP | Single Responsibility Principle | A class should have one, and only one, reason to change |
| OCP | Open Closed Principle | You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it |
| LSP | Liskov Substitution Principle | Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes |
| ISP | Interface Segregation Principle | Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific |
| DIP | Dependency Inversion Principle | Depend on abstractions, not on concretions |

# The Principles of Object Oriented Programming

In computer programming, **SOLID** (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion) is a mnemonic acronym that stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design.

| acronym | Concept |
| :-----: | ------- |
| **S**RP | Single Responsibility Principle `A class should have one, and only one, reason to change` |
| **O**CP | Open Closed Principle `You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it` |
| **L**SP | Liskov Substitution Principle `Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes` |
| **I**SP | Interface Segregation Principle `Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific` |
| **D**IP | Dependency Inversion Principle `Depend on abstractions, not on concretions` |
